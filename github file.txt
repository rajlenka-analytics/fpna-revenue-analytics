Below is a true nano-step, zero-confusion guide to create your GitHub account, choose the right username, add projects, and publish everything online so recruiters can open it from your resume.

Follow this exactly in order. Do not skip steps.

PART 1 — CREATE YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT (10 MINUTES)
Step 1: Open GitHub

Open browser

Go to: https://github.com

Click Sign up (top right)

Step 2: Choose the RIGHT username (VERY IMPORTANT)
Best username format for you (professional)

Use real name–based, not fancy names.

✅ Recommended (pick ONE):

rajkishore-lenka

rajkishorelenka

raj-lenka-analytics

rajkishore-fpa

❌ Avoid:

nicknames

Password: strong (store it)

➡ Click Continue

Step 4: Account type

Select Free

Skip team questions

Verify email (check inbox)

PART 2 — CREATE YOUR FIRST REPOSITORY (THIS IS WHAT RECRUITERS SEE)

A repository (repo) = a project folder.

Step 5: Create repository

After login → click + (top right)

Click New repository

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

You are positioning yourself as:

FP&A / Revenue Analyst who understands business, not a coder

That is exactly what pays ₹25–35 LPA.

✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NEXT (ORDERED)

Paste this README → Commit

Upload:

1 Excel FP&A file

1 SQL file or screenshot

Your GitHub will now:

Support Financial Analyst / FP&A / Revenue Analyst applications

Increase shortlisting probability

NOT create interview risk

If you want, next I can:

2️⃣ Tell you which project to upload first
3️⃣ Prepare interview questions from your GitHub

Just tell me what you want next.

where i need to upload these files.

You are in the correct place. You have already edited the README.
Now I’ll show you exactly where and how to upload the actual files (Excel / SQL / Python) into this same repository.

Follow these nano-steps.

FIRST: Finish what you’re doing now (IMPORTANT)

In the popup you showed:

Commit message → keep

Update README.md


Keep “Commit directly to the main branch” selected

Click Commit changes (green button)

✅ Your README is now saved.

NOW: WHERE TO UPLOAD FILES (THIS ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION)

All files go into this same repository:

👉 fpna-revenue-analytics

You will upload them from the repository home page, not inside README edit mode.

STEP-BY-STEP: UPLOAD FILES (NO CODING NEEDED)
Step 1: Go to repository home

Click Code (top-left tab), or click the repo name:

fpna-revenue-analytics


You should see:

README.md

No other files (for now)

Step 2: Click “Add file”

Top-right area → click Add file
Then click Upload files

WHAT FILES TO UPLOAD (MINIMUM SET)

Upload these 3–4 files only. This is enough for a top FP&A profile.

✅ File 1: Excel FP&A / P&L model

Upload:

fpna_forecast_vs_actual.xlsx
OR

management_pnl_analysis.xlsx

If you don’t have one yet:

Create a simple Excel with:

Revenue

Variable Cost

Contribution Margin

Budget vs Actual

✅ File 2: SQL analysis (VERY SIMPLE)

You can upload any one:

Option A: .sql file

revenue_analysis.sql


Option B (if no SQL file):

Upload a PDF or image of SQL queries you used

Name it:

sql_revenue_queries.pdf


Both are acceptable.

✅ File 3: Python (Basic)

Create a file on your laptop named:

basic_data_cleaning.py


Paste this (same as before):

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("sample_data.csv")
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)

print(df.describe())


Upload this file.

✅ (Optional but good) File 4: Sample data

Upload:

sample_data.csv


This can be dummy data (10–20 rows).

STEP 3: Commit uploaded files

After selecting files:

Scroll down

Commit message:

Add FP&A and revenue analysis files


Keep Commit directly to main

Click Commit changes

✅ Files are now live and public.

OPTIONAL (BUT CLEAN): CREATE FOLDERS

If you want it extra professional (optional):

Before uploading:

Click Add file → Create new file

Name it:

excel/README.md


Add text:

FP&A and financial analysis Excel models


Commit

Repeat for:

sql/README.md

python/README.md

Then upload files inside those folders.

⚠️ This is optional. Flat structure is also fine.

FINAL CHECK (DO THIS)

Open your repo and confirm you see:

README.md

Excel file

SQL file or PDF

Python file

If yes → ✅ You are done

VERY IMPORTANT (RECRUITER POV)

Recruiters will:

Read README (you did perfectly)

Click 1 Excel file

Glance at SQL / Python

Close GitHub

They do NOT expect:
❌ perfect code
❌ advanced Python
❌ dashboards

Your setup is exactly correct for FP&A / Financial Analyst roles.
